### Masters student in Computer Science at the FU Berlin

I am particularly interested in developing and analysing Windows applications, especially reverse engineering.
The attraction of reverse engineering for me is that the source code is often not available and it is necessary to work with binary code to find vulnerabilities or malicious functions, for example.
I am currently working on DMA attacks.
